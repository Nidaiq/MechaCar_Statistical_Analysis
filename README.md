## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

[Image 1](Deliverable_1.png) shows the formula and output for formula to predict MPB.  Looking at the formula intercept, vehicle length and ground clearance provide the non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset.  

The slope of the model is not considered to be zero as the p-value is 5.35e-11 and is a lot lower than then 0.05.  Therefore, there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  This reinstates that the slope of the line is not zero.

The Multiple R-squared values of the equation is 0.7149.  Which indicates that over 71% of the time the linear formula can be used to predict mpg of MechaCar prototype effectively. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

[Image 2](Deliverable_2a.png) shows the total summary.  Where as [Image 3](Deliverable_2b.png) shows the lot summary table.  The current manufacturing data meets the design specification.  According to the data, the total mean is 1498.78 and the median is 1500 which shows that the data has a normal distribution.  Although the standard deviation is 7.89 indicating that the data is scattered over wide range.  The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch and the current data shows that the variance of the current lots is 62.29 thus under the specification.  So, the current manufacturing data meets this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total.  However, according to the lot summary, the variance of Lot 3 has the highest standard deviation of 13% and the variance is 170.29.  Therefore, on its own Lot 3 would fail the specification.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

[Image 4](Deliverable_3a.png) shows that according to the one sample t test.   At 95% confidence interval and a p-value of 0.06028 we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

[Image 5](Deliverable_3b.png) shows the one sample t-test for lot1, which shows the p-value of 1 indicating that we fail to reject the null hypothesis.  

Similarly, according to [Image 6](Deliverable_3c.png) for lot2, with a p-value of 0.6072.  This indicates that the [Image 7](Deliverable_3d.png) for lot 3 with a p-value of 0.04168 indicates that it is lower than 0.05 therefore, we have evidence to suggest that we can reject the null hypothesis.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs. Competition

There are numerous factors that are important to consumers while buying a car.  For an average customer, cost is always the primary factor which includes the initial cost of buying a car and the city and highway fuel efficiency and maintenance cost which would indicate the ongoing cost associated with the car.  Another trend that is following these days is that consumers want a futuristic car.  According to [Automotiveworld](https://www.automotiveworld.com/articles/what-do-consumers-want-from-the-car-of-the-future/) consumers are looking for cars with enhanced technology such as self-driving cars.

As the technology is constantly evolving and may require time to develop for MechaCar, we would run two separate analysis.  We will assume that that initial cost of buying the car is the same for MechaCar and the competitor we are comparing the car to.  We will look at the cost of maintaining  the car which can add up for the consumer later.  Our null hypothesis would be that cost of maintaining the MechaCar is not different then cost of maintaining the competitor car.  The alternative hypothesis is that the cost of maintenance is different.  A two-sample t-test to find out if there is a statistical difference in between the distribution means from the two samples.  To perform this test, we would need the data for maintenance for both MechaCar and the competitor car as well.

For the second test we will run could compare a few high-tech aspects that we can add to our MechaCar, such as, the carâ€™s ability to break when detecting collision.  For this we can check the response time of MechaCar when detecting front end collision and response time of the competitor car when it comes to front end collision.  The second parameter can also be response time of both time cars before they automatically break when it comes to front end collision.   Our null hypothesis can be that both cars have the same response time when detecting collision and automatically break and our alternative hypothesis can be that the response times are different. An ANOVA test can also be run for both parameter to check the difference.
